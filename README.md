## Nonlinear Dynamics of Wind turbines with large deflections  
### Group Members: Tom Wilkinson, James Foster, Rishindra Melanathuru, Lucian Cabrini, Kenneth Chotitawan
### Aims of the project:
Perform experimental work which accurately measures the nonlinear behaviour of a flexible cantilever beam resembling a wind turbine blade, so the results become a reference for other simulation models. Expected nonlinear behaviour include large bending deflections and bending-torsional mode coupling.
Develop an analytical model that takes into account torsional-bending coupling and is representative of the experimental model.
Develop a reduced order model of a finite element model that is representative of the experimental model.
Understand current industry standards and aero elastic codes in terms of Wind Turbine blades. Understand and analyse the performance and limitations of industry software such as Bladed. Analyse the solving methods these industrial programs use.
Compare the performances of the experimental, analytical and reduced order models with Industrial Wind turbine blade models and validate the results.
